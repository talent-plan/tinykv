# Project2

code sturcture:

`tick()` trigger event -> request to `step()` -> `step()` handle event by calling `sendxxx` method that sending request to `Msgs` -> receivers handle request by calling `handlexxx` method and sending response to `Msgs` -> sender handle response by calling `handlexxxResponse`


## Project2aa

### Target

1. leader election
2. pass Project2aa

### Detail

roadmap from `raft/doc.go`

1. start from `raft.Raft.tick()`，advanced by `Node`。In this method, Each states have different behavior: `Follower` and `Candiate` will take election action, `Leader` will take heartbeat ation. There are two RPCs: `MessageType_MsgHup`, `MessageType_MsgBeat` mapping that two actions and needed to implement in `tickElection()`和`tickHeartbeat()`. And these will be handled by step.
2. Election, start from `startElection()`, the detail of this method descripted in paper, first it's state need transfer to `Follower`, it needs `lastLogIndex` and `LastLogTerm` implment in `RaftLog`。After that, it need send `sendRequestVote` to every peer without self. `ElectionTimeout` should be reset when receive heartbeat or timeout. Receiver revice handle this request and return response to sender. sender will count the tickets, if over half of peers are agree, it will become leader; if over half of peers are disagree, it will become follower
3. HeartBeat, start from `startHeartBeat()`,it differ from the paper: it divide heartbeat and appendEntries. So, this method is simple, just needed to send heartbeat periodically.
